# Arduino Weather Station Project
In this Arduino project, I created a simple weather station using a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and an LCD screen to display the readings. The DHT11 sensor provides reliable measurements of temperature in Celsius and humidity levels, making it ideal for basic weather monitoring applications. The Arduino reads data from the DHT11 sensor and then prints the temperature and humidity values onto a 16x2 LCD screen.

Due to Tinkercad's lack of support for the DHT11 sensor, different pins were used in the schematic compared to a real-world setup. This project serves as a practical introduction to working with sensors and displays, showcasing how to interface with them using Arduino.
